Four Social Situations Activity (30 min).
"Why would you behave that way?"

*Key takeaway 1*: We act differently depending on who we are interacting with and what the situation is. Our behavior changes to make a good impression on the person we are interacting with in a situation.  

There are different expectations for how to make a good impression with the people you are interacting with.  

*Key takeaway 2*: The self is fluid and situational.

Most comfortable in? Most uncomfortable in?

##Slide - Impression Management

(Goffman 1973) sees social life as played out by actors on a stage (or on many stages) because how we act depends on the roles we play at a given time.

Goffman called these impression management performances. He saw people as fragile and vulnerable to embarrassment and humiliation, which is why they work so hard to manage the impressions others have of them.  

impression management is the idea that we try to control the impression that other people have of us.

Daily life consists of a series of social interactions in which we try to manage the impressions we make of ourselves.

Goffman saw social interactions as occurring in both front and back regions. Using the language of the theater, you can also think of these as front and back stages.

The front region is where the performance takes place, which has a particular audience. In a job interview, the performance may take place in an audience of one or two persons. The stakes of the performance are very high, so all actors playing a role put a lot of energy into their performance.

The back region is where the actors retreat once the performance is over. The person being interviewed may head to a nearby coffee shop to talk to a friend about how it went.


Daily life is filled with thousands of written and unwritten rules about how social interactions are supposed to take place, and they are constantly being reshaped through our creative response to new situations.

This means we constantly need to learn the rules as we go about our day.

Once in an interaction, people are constantly interpreting what others are saying and doing just as they are trying to manage the impression they give to others.

We take for granted the immensely complicated, continuous control of our appearance and actions.

## Non Face-to-face Roles

Examples? Internet, social media, letters, texts, resumes?

Did you guys have a resume assignment for you communications class?
What is a resume? Is a resume an impression?


## Roles

In each of their roles, they act somewhat differently, and they try to keep what they do in each role distinct from what they do in their other roles. People find it very stressful when boundaries break down or when they cannot reconcile their role in one area of their life with their role in another.

The textbook gives the example of having two friends who do not like each other; we might spend time with both separately and never mention to either friend that we are close with the other.  

Audience segregation.

“Civil inattention is the process whereby strangers who are in close proximity demonstrate that they are aware of one another, without imposing on each other,” one definition stated. “It’s a recognition of the claims of others to a public space, and a sign also of their own personal boundaries.”


# Three Reasons
There are three important reasons why social interaction and the study of daily life is central to sociology.

First, our daily routines teach us a lot about ourselves as social beings and about social life.
What we do over the course of the day reveals patterns of behavior and how social life is structured.

Second, studying daily life reveals how we act creatively to shape reality.
This happens through social interaction, which is the process by which we act and react to the people around us.
Another term for social interaction is microsociology, which you may remember from Chapter 1 of the textbook.
How we react to others and how they react to us affects our perceptions of reality.

Third, we learn a lot about larger social systems and institutions by studying social interactions in everyday life.
Agency is an important component in the study of microsociology and social interaction.
Although social behavior is guided by social forces, humans have the ability to make individual decisions and shape reality.
